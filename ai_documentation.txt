Reily - for part 3 I asked chrome how to save the visualizations output by Bertopic and it said: 'To save a visualization generated by BERTopic, which typically uses Plotly for interactive plots, you can use the fig.write_html() method.'. This did not work for LDA, and so I also googled this and got: "To save an LDA visualization created with the pyLDAvis library in Python, you can use the pyLDAvis.save_html() function to export it as a standalone HTML file"
