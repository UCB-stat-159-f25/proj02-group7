Question: Why is my spaCy not working in the following code?
import spacy
spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_sm")

Answer: To fix it: ✅ 1. Install spaCy Open a terminal (or a notebook cell with !) and run: !pip install spacy
If you are using conda: conda install -c conda-forge spacy

This installs the model that spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") needs.


Reily - for part 3 I asked chrome how to save the visualizations output by Bertopic and it said: 'To save a visualization generated by BERTopic, which typically uses Plotly for interactive plots, you can use the fig.write_html() method.'.
